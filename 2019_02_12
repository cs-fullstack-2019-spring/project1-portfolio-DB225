Project PORTFOLIO: Day1.

###MORNING
This morning I did a sketch of the portfolio I want to build.
I put all the ideas about the contain and the disposition of all content.
You can see it in the picture named "morningSketch1" and "morningSketch2".
In "morningSketch1" you can see on the right side a hamburger button, once we click on it, this icon changes to be a cross icon, and at the same time
directs us to the content of the page.
In the middle there is a the sentence "welcome to my portfolio" which make a rotation.(I'll try to do it)
"morningSketch2" is the content of the page. As you can see, there is a horizontal navbar, but I'll do it vertically.
The letters from A to G are referred to each link in the navbar : ABOUT ME(a), SKILLS(b) etc...
Each page will have his own background and of course his own content.


###AFTERNOON
This afternoon I begin with the navbar. I just tried to make it vertically, clickable and fixed.
Concerning the links, I created a page for each link with different backgrounds, just to see how it will be.
